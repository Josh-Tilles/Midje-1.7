Midje has three test directories with three different
purposes. It also has two legacy test directories.

WARNING: As with all categories
http://www.exampler.com/testing-com/writings/pnsqc-2005-communication.pdf
these have fuzzy boundaries. Moreover, the categories have
evolved, so there are a number of tests in the wrong
category. But maintainers should try to make things
less-wrong.

as_documentation
    The wiki user documentation is intended to be a good
    guide for users. The `as-documentation` tests should
    serve as a useful supplement. That means that these
    tests should (1) have extra-good explanations and
    variable names, and (2) be restricted to information an
    expert user would want to know. Details and things that
    "should just work in the obvious way" should go
    elsewhere. 

user
    These tests are written using the midje.sweet
    namespace. That is, they don't reach "under the
    hood". They, however, explore behaviors that are
    visible to the user, but not one she wants to learn
    about. For example, exceptions during parsing
    are reported the same no matter how deep in a
    structure they happen. Why should a user care?

    These tests also include ones that perhaps should
    to in as_documentation, but aren't pretty enough (yet). 

implementation
    These tests are for utility functions in particular
    namespaces.

    One arguable case: I'm considering line-number
    reporting to belong here. Although the tests use
    the sweet interface, different places in the code that
    produce line numbers may need to use different
    mechanisms. So line numbers are tied to particular
    namespaces in a way that'd be muddled if line
    number tests were put in the `user` namespace.
    

LEGACY

midje
    Many `midje` tests mix together `user` and
    `implementation` tests. As you work on the namespaces,
    migrate their contents to the appropriate place.

behaviors
    Intended for tests that now belong in `user`, but
    often mixes in implementation details.
